<body>

Once upon a midnight dreary, 

While I websurfed weak and weary, 

Over many a strange and spurious website

Of hot chicks galore:


And when I clicked my faved bookmark, 

Suddenly there came a warning, 

And my heart was filled with mourning, 

Mourning for my dear amour.


'Tis not possible!, I pleaded, 

But my browser, so conceited, 

Remained blank... Then I repeated, 

But just a blank, and nothing more...


With a scream, I was defeated, 

For my cookies were deleted, 

So I begged, no longer seated, 

"Give me back my free hardcore!"


Then, in answer to my query, 

Through the net I loved so dearly, 

Came its answer, dark and dreary: 

Quoth the server, 404.
